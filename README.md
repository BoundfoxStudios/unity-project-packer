# Unity Project Packer

This little tools helps you to pack your Unity project to upload it for support at our Discord server.

## Usage

Please download the binary file for your operating system and move it to the root folder of your Unity project. 
The root folder of a Unity project contains the following three folders:

```
- Your Unity Game
  - Assets
  - Packages
  - ProjectSettings
```

Place the binary directly in the root folder and run it. 
It then will create a zip file. 

Upload the zip file either directly to Discord (if it is smaller than 50 MB) or use WeTransfer.com.
